# Simple tailwindcss starter files

This is a simple setup for developing tailwind projects.

## Usage

Install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install
```

Run the Tailwind CLI in watch mode:

```
npm run watch
```

You can use any tailwindcss classes in any `.html` file in the root directory of your project. If you have any custom css, put it into the `input.css` file. Add any configurations values into the `tailwind.config.js` file.

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

You only need to deploy your `*.html` and `css/style.css` files
